# OOP Course EX3 PYTHON

In fact during the course, most of our tasks were to build graph classes and apply to those classes different algorithms in graph theory, for example Dyjkstra.
In the current and most interesting mission of all, we were asked to convert our code to Python from Java.
This mission was supposed to teach us to develop OOP in Python for the first time and it was a success. In addition, we learned to use with the MATPLOTLIB library for visualization and PLOTING.
Among the other tasks, we had to compare our code in JAVA, PYTHON, NETWORKX and measure runtimes. The following is a general result:
See detailed plotting in WIKI

## Comparison

For more comparison resaults go to our  [wiki ](https://github.com/IdoGuzi/python_OOP/wiki) and you will find a lot more info and plots.

## How To Use

You need to install [python ](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run our tests to see any resaults.

```bash
TestDiGraph.py
TestGraphAlgo.py
```

In order to see our visulizition code contact us (We Used Jupyter Notbook IDE & matplotlib)

## Main Classes

```python:
DiGraph.py (includes vertecs class aka 'NodeData')    --> Our Weigthed & Directed Garph
GraphAlgo.py    -->Our Algorithem class

```

Pull requests are welcome.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
